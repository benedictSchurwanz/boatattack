This is a clone of the popular two-player naval boat-combat-blind-attacking-with-cannons-on-a-coordinate-grid game, that is most definitely not infringing on any copyrights of "Battleship". 

This is intended to be nothing more than a fun solo project for coding practice. 

I intend to work out the game logic as a text-based terminal command-line interface, then add Rails and Javascript browser-based interface. 

I intend to practice Agile workflow and good Git hygiene as if this were a team project, although I'll be working by myself.

This is still very much a work in progress.
