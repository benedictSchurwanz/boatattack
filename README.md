# Boat Attack

v0.1

This is a clone of the popular two-player naval boat-combat-blind-attacking-with-cannons-on-a-coordinate-grid game, that is most definitely not infringing on any copyrights of "Battleship", as written from scratch by me, based on notes about the rules of the game. (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_\(game\)) and the original [challenge](challenge-readme.md) from Dev Bootcamp.)

This is intended to be nothing more than a fun solo project for coding practice.

I intend to work out the game logic as a text-based terminal command-line interface, then add Rails and Javascript browser-based interface.

I intend to practice Agile workflow and good Git hygiene as if this were a team project, although I'll be working by myself.

This is still very much a work in progress.

## Getting Started

<!-- These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. -->

Install Ruby, clone this repo,

```
git clone https://github.com/benedictify/boat-attack.git
```

and then run

```
ruby runner.rb
```

### Prerequisites

<!-- What things you need to install the software and how to install them -->

Install the latest version of Ruby. There are several [methods](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) available to do this. Two package managers are [RVM](http://rvm.io) and [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation). I use rbenv. If you don't already have it, you will need to install Homebrew as well. (Find it [here](https://brew.sh) and follow their instructions to install.)

With Homebrew installed, to install rbenv, simply type

```
brew install rbenv
```

Then to install a version of Ruby, you can get a current list of available versions,

```
rbenv install -l
```

And then install your chosen version. Pick one that starts with just numbers. At this time the latest stable version is 2.4.2

```
rbenv install 2.4.2
```


### Installing

Nothing special about the development environment at this time, the program is pretty simple.


## Running the tests

<!-- Explain how to run the automated tests for this system -->

The test suite is written in RSpec.
